## What is debugging

> Debugging is the process of identifying and removing errors from computer hardware or software. - Wiki

> Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it. - Brian W. Kernighan

## Debugging is hard

- It is an essential skill along with coding but different than coding
- It needs a context. We loose context when we are distracted
- Debugging may take more than 8 hours
- Debugging may require more than 1 debugger at different times
- Trial and Error will help in 'Hello World' programs only

## Scientific method for debugging

- Based on scientific method
- Hypothesis driven
- Documentation
- Applicable to any debugging
